							Temperature is encoded in the music in a few ways.
							First, we have the tenor line, which takes the range
							of temperatures from 1918 through 2018, breaks them
							into five equal parts, and makes them sound like
							this scale.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="text-3">
						<p>
							Next, we have the basso continuo—the chords and bass
							note—which takes the same range of temperatures from
							1918 through 2018, breaks them into five equal
							parts, and makes them sound like this common chord
							progression.
						</p>

					<div id="text-4">
						<p>
							Finally, for arctic ice data—area and extent—we have
							two additional insturments. You will hear them come
							in at the end, and they break arctic ice data into
							seven equal parts.
